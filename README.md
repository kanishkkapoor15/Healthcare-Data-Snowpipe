# Healthcare-Data-Snowpipe
A snowflake based ELT data pipeline built using python-snowflake 
🚑 Simulated Healthcare Data Pipeline Using FastAPI & Snowflake 🏥



Just completed a full-scale ELT data pipeline project focused on the Irish healthcare sector, simulating real-time hospital data — from patient intake to appointment tracking.

🔗 What I built:



✅ FastAPI backend to simulate 100+ realistic hospital records using Faker

✅ Direct ingestion of data into Snowflake using the Snowflake Python connector

✅ Designed separate RAW and TRANSFORMED schemas

✅ Created a transformed layer with interpreted features:



Age groups

Weekly appointment trends

Risk level flags based on patient status and attendance

✅ Conducted SQL-based data exploration and built visual charts directly within Snowflake UI

🔍 This pipeline simulates how modern healthcare systems can leverage real-time data analytics for resource planning, risk detection, and performance tracking.
